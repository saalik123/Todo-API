# Todo-API
TodoAPI App- A fairly complex Todo app with user authentication.It shows how we can create our own RESTful APIs for our apps
and consume it on the front end. The API it uses is built using node js.
It uses jQuery and ajax on front end and requests its own api for data. This app is just a glimpse of how single page web apps work and 
the power of ajax which allow pages to update the content without having to refresh the page.
